# Api Methods
  1.	GetProducts
  If the category parameter is empty, all products will be listed, and if it is not empty, products belonging to the relevant category will be listed.
  When a request is made to the method, the memory cache will be checked first and if it is full, products will be given from here. 
  If the cache is empty, the records will be read from the database and the memory cache will be filled and the products will be listed. 
  List<ProductDto> will be returned in the Response Data field.
  2.	CreateOrder
  Http POST. It will take the CreateOrderRequest pattern as a parameter.By using the CreateOrderRequest object, insert operation will be made into the Order and OrderDetail tables. 
  It will be added to the SendMail queue in the RabitMq service in order to send the e-mail to the sales customer asynchronously.
  The Id information of the order record created in the Response Data field will be returned.
